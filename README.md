## Skills

**Problem-solving:** I love problem-solving! Researching and implementing a STEM/maker workshop and Forest School woodland with limited resources, non-negotiable deadlines and complex safe-guarding issues resulted in life-changing opportunities for children growing up in a deprived area of North London.

**Communication:** Clarity, honesty and empathy for me have been key for strong, positive communication with peers, the children I have worked with and a variety of stakeholders from parents to senior leaders and governors. This has been an essential part of delivering amazing opportunities to our children through the positive relationships that have been established.

**Initiative and delivery:** I have been repeatedly entrusted with special projects far outside my job remit and current knowledge having gained the trust that I can work flexibly, am driven to achieve and can learn whatever new skills may be required.

**Growth mindset:** Good fortune has repeadly found me in uncomfortable situations requiring rapid and effective learning of new skills and knowledge. I have developed a deep understanding of the importance of a growth mindset, seeing mistakes as learning opportunities and benefit of embracing challenges.

**Reflection:** When implementing a radically new Forest School pedagogy into my school with independent responsibility for a small team, I used constant reflection, daily discussions and an agile approach to dynamically adjust our practice maximising benefits for children, staff and stakeholders.

**Meta-cognition:** Research, leading teaching, being a cross-pedagogical educator, and a love of learning have given me insights into my learning processes helping me to learn more effectively and feel that everything is within reach.

**Patience and resilience:** I was a primary school teacher for twelve years. Do you need to know more?

**Empathy:** Working closely with vulnerable children and exhausted, overstretched colleagues has taught me how essential empathy is in positive collaboration and cohesive teamwork for an effective and enjoyable working life. Combined with strong, honest communication, this played a key part in creating a Forest School team with unprecedented work satisfaction and exceptional experiences for our children, and was the foundation of my successful group collaborations at Makers.

**Creativity:** From furniture design to living willow mazes, and irrigation systems to STEM curriculum, creativity is an unaescapable part of me and an essential part of finding the best solution to any problem.

**Precision:** Fulfilling the complex needs of a diverse range of children and colleagues in an unpredicatable environment and above all the extreme safeguarding requirements of Forest School has been ample preparation for Makers group engineering projects working with varied peers and managing complex codebases.

**User focus:** Reflective teaching is a purely user focussed process and a natural progression from years of furniture design and craftsmanship where beautiful, functional creations are designed for a specific user experience.
